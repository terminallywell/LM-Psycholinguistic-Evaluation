Language Processing: Humans vs. Language Models

CS 485 Final Project

Brian Cho, Alexander Lavrenenko, Andrew Vu

Our project aims to investigate the difference between the patterns in the processing of language exhibited by humans and language models.
We will use a set of tasks derived from prior psycholinguistic studies that examined human performance pertaining to syntactic constraints, dependencies, and even errors,
and apply them to language models of various architectures.
By comparing the results across different language models and with human performance data, we hope to better understand the fundamental differences between human cognition and language models
in the way they process and understand language.
